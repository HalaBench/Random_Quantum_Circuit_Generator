# Random_Quantum_Circuit_Generator
this repository contains my submition for the QOSF mentorship program (task 4)
https://www.qosf.org/

# Description of the task
By taking into account the number of qubits, depths, and gate base as inputs, this function produces a quantum circuit at random. It utilizes quantum gates that can manipulate either 1 or 2 qubits.
